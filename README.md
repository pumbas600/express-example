# Basic Express with Typescript API Example

## Installation
1. Install dependencies using npm (`npm install`) or yarn (`yarn`).
2. Copy the `config.example.json` file and rename it to `config.json`. Update any of the fields if required.

## Scripts
Run the scripts using `npm run <script>` or `yarn <script>`. 

- `devServer` - Runs the backend api with hot-reloading (Automatically restarts as you make changes).
- `build` - Compiles the Typescript into Javascript.
- `start` - Runs the latest built code. (Make sure to use `build` before running so that it's up to date).
